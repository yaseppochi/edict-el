BUGS

1.   [OK] Register some insert [ and edit - can't, are none ] methods.
2.   [OK] Deal with the case of first entry in the dictionary.
3.   Give kanjidic entries precedence in list.
4.   Give private dictionary entries precedence in list.
5.   Editing does not work when the dictionaries aren't loaded
     (edict-user-dictionary is unbound).  Probably should also check
     for existence of edict-buffer.
6.   Completion of search methods will find insert methods, eg, need to
     filter in the same way as history.

PRETTIFICATION

1.   Move customizable variables to separate file.
